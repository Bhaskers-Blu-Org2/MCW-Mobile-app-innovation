Contoso Air, founded in 1932, is a leader in the air travel industry, with service to more than 70 different countries/regions around the globe. Contoso is currently modernizing their entire ticketing and operations platform. With its global workforce, there is a need to access data with extremely low latency thus requiring replication across geographical regions. Furthermore, employees are becoming increasingly mobile and digital savvy. They expect to be able to have access to their data in real time from any type of the common mobile platforms; be it Universal Windows Platform (UWP), iOS, or Android. Contoso's competitors are smaller and nimbler, and as such, they have been able to transform digitally much faster and provide employees and customers with a better experience.

To remain competitive and improve their customer satisfaction ratings, Contoso Air wishes to modernize their baggage handling and tracking process. This includes the introduction of RFID luggage tags, equipping baggage handlers with mobile devices to perform luggage scans, a customer luggage tracking mobile application, and adding IoT enabled RFID antennas and scanners throughout the baggage handling process. Employees and customers alike will be able to track the exact position of a piece of luggage from the time that it leaves its owner's hands to the time that it returns to them at the baggage claim.

## Target audience

- Infrastructure architect

## Abstract

### Workshop

In this workshop, you will design an IoT solution for an end-to-end mobile baggage tracking system that leverages cloud services and cross-platform mobile development.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to design an IoT solution, including mobile apps, using cloud services.

### Whiteboard design session

In this whiteboard design session, you will work with a group to design an IoT solution using data emitted from RFID tags attached to airline passengers' checked luggage, and mobile applications to allow employees and customers to track those bags from any device.

At the end of this whiteboard design session, you will be better able to design an IoT solution, including mobile apps, by leveraging cloud services.

### Hands-on lab

In this hands-on lab, you will implement the steps to build an IoT solution for an end-to-end mobile baggage tracking system, that leverages cloud services and cross-platform mobile development.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will discover how to leverage Azure services to implement an IoT solution that includes, RFID tracking, mobile apps, and a continuous integration pipeline for developers.
