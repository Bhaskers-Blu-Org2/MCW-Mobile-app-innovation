## Before the whiteboard design session: How to prepare

Before conducting your first whiteboard design session:

-   Read the Attendee guide (including the case study) and Trainer guide

-   Become familiar with all key points and activities

-   Plan the point you want to stress, which questions you want to drive, transitions, and be ready to answer questions

-   Prior to the whiteboard design session, discuss the case study to pick up more ideas

-   Make notes for later

## During the whiteboard design session: Tips for an effective whiteboard design session

**Refer to the Trainer guide** to stay on track and observe the timings.

**Do not expect to memorize every detail** of the whiteboard design session.

When participants are doing activities, you can **look ahead to refresh your memory**.

-   **Adjust activity and whiteboard design session pace** as needed to allow time for presenting, feedback, and sharing

-   **Add examples, points, and stories** from your own experience. Think about stories you can share that help you make your points clearly and effectively.

-   **Consider creating a "parking lot"** to record issues or questions raised that are outside the scope of the whiteboard design session or that can be answered later. Decide how you will address these issues, so you can acknowledge them without being derailed by them.

***Have fun**! Encourage participants to have fun and share!*

**Involve your participants.** Talk and share your knowledge but always involve your participants, even while you are the one speaking.

**Ask questions** and get them to share to fully involve your group in the learning process

**Ask first**, whenever possible. Before launching into a topic, learn your audience's opinions about it and experiences with it. Asking first enables you to assess their level of knowledge and experience, and leaves them more open to what you are presenting.

**Wait for responses**. If you ask a question such as, "What's your experience with (fill in the blank)?" then wait. Do not be afraid of a little silence. If you leap into the silence, your participants will feel you are not serious about involving them and will become passive. Give participants a chance to think, and if no one answers, patiently ask again. You will usually get a response.

# Mobile app innovation whiteboard design session student guide

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this whiteboard design session, you will work with a group to design an IoT solution using data emitted from RFID tags attached to airline passengers' checked luggage, and mobile applications to allow employees and customers to track those bags from any device.

At the end of this whiteboard design session, you will be better able to design an IoT solution, including mobile apps, by leveraging cloud services.

## Step 1: Review the customer case study 

**Outcome** 

Analyze your customer’s needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions: With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips. 

1.  Meet your table participants and trainer 
2.  Read all of the directions for steps 1–3 in the student guide 
3.  As a table team, review the following customer case study

### Customer situation

Contoso Air, founded in 1932, is a leader in the air travel industry, with service to more than 70 different countries/regions around the globe. Contoso is currently modernizing their entire ticketing and operations platform. With a global workforce in over 70 countries/regions, there is a need to access data with extremely low latency thus requiring replication across geographical regions. Furthermore, employees are becoming increasingly mobile and digital savvy. They expect to be able to have access to their data in real time from any type of the common mobile platforms: be it UWP, iOS, or Android. Contoso's competitors are smaller and nimbler, as such they have been able to transform digitally much faster and provide employees and customers with a better experience.

Over time, Contoso hopes to be able to shift to a 100% cloud infrastructure, but they have an extensive number of on-premises legacy systems which are extremely costly to upgrade. They are interested in using Azure to help securely expose specific information housed in those legacy systems accessible to other applications. This will also enable their global workforce to tailor their own application experiences in order to perform their jobs accurately and effectively. For this, they will require both a broadly available, highly scalable cloud that also offers hybrid capabilities to bridge to their on-premises infrastructure.

Contoso has already recently migrated email, file sharing, collaboration, chat, and VoIP systems into the cloud by taking advantage of the services provided in Office 365. As such, they have already set up federated AD, as well as other Microsoft 365 services (including the Microsoft Graph) which are all available for integration. They have various resources spread across three Azure regions.

To remain competitive and improve their customer satisfaction ratings, Contoso Air wishes to modernize their baggage handling and tracking process. This includes the introduction of RFID luggage tags, equipping baggage handlers with mobile devices to perform luggage scans, a customer luggage tracking mobile application, and adding IoT enabled RFID antennas and scanners throughout the baggage handling process. Employees and customers alike will be able to track the exact position of a piece of luggage from the time that it leaves its owner's hands to the time that it returns to them at the baggage claim.

At any given time, Contoso has an average of 120 active flights on the ground (processing baggage) at 60 locations worldwide. Each flight has an estimated 180 customers with an average of 360 checked bags -- it is beneficial that the handling and tracking of these bags is improved.

By implementing this system, Contoso will be able to improve their metrics as it relates to lost luggage. At the same time, they will improve their satisfaction ratings by providing their customers with piece of mind by giving them visibility into exactly where their luggage is at all times. Even if luggage is lost, Contoso Air can start the search at the last known scan location, thus saving time and money.

### Customer needs

1.  Low-latency data replication across geographical regions

2.  Client applications for web, iOS, Android, and UWP

3.  Real-time location data for baggage

4.  RFID labels, antennas, scanners, and employee mobile application

5.  The ability to quickly innovate on new mobile application features with high quality

-   Automated Build, Test, and Deployment

-   Crash/Analytics

-   cDashboarding

### Customer objections

1.  Contoso Air is worried about potential security-related disruptions to the system

2.  There is concern over Azure's ability to communicate reliably with IoT RFID scanners

3.  Is Xamarin the right solution for the customer mobile applications?

4.  How does this solution guarantee low data latency?

5.  There will be thousands of scanners being used at a given time, does this solution scale?

6.  The new system may require querying data from on-premises data sources, how do you bridge that gap?

### Infographic of common scenarios 

![This data flow diagram illustrates how Microsoft Azure services like IoT Hub, Data Lake, and SQL Data Warehouse enable 'big data' solutions that can the handle high velocity data that is typical of IoT. Components in this diagram interact with each other between end users and the enterprise, and the components are organized in eight groups that flow in the following order: On Premises, Ingest, Stream Processing, Batch Storage, Speed Serving, Batch Processing, Batch View Serving, and Analytics Clients. At this time, we are unable to capture all of the information in the window. Future versions of this course should address this.](media/image2.png "Common Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios infographic")

# Mobile app innovation whiteboard design session trainer guide

## Step 1: Review the customer case study

-   Check in with your table participants to introduce yourself as the trainer

-   Ask, "What questions do you have about the customer case study?"

-   Briefly review the steps and time frames of the whiteboard design session

-   Ready, set, go! Let the table participants begin

## Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution

-   Check in with your tables to ensure that they are transitioning from step to step on time

-   Provide some feedback on their responses to the business needs and design

    -   Try asking questions first that will lead the participants to discover the answers on their own

-   Provide feedback for their responses to the customer's objections

    -   Try asking questions first that will lead the participants to discover the answers on their own

## Step 3: Present the solution

-   Determine which table will be paired with your table before Step 3 begins

-   For the first round, assign one table as the presenting team and the other table as the customer

-   Have the presenting team present their solution to the customer team 

    -   Have the customer team provide one objection for the presenting team to respond to
    
    -   The presentation, objections, and feedback should take no longer than 15 minutes

    -   If needed, the trainer may also provide feedback

## Wrap-up

-   Have the table participants reconvene with the larger session group to hear the facilitator/SME share the following preferred solution.

## Preferred target audience

Sage Robertson, CTO, Contoso Air

The primary audience is the business and technology decision makers. Usually we talk to the infrastructure managers who report to the chief information officer (CIO), or to application sponsors (like a vice president \[VP\] line of business \[LOB\], or chief marketing officer \[CMO\]), or to those that represent the business unit IT or developers that report to application sponsors.

## Preferred solution

*High-level architecture*

1.  Without getting into the details (the following sections will address the particular details), diagram your initial vision for handling the top-level requirements for data security, ingestion, processing, and exposure to the mobile applications. You will refine this diagram as you proceed.

    The high-level view of the entire solution appears as follows.

    ![Icons that are connected by arrows comprise this diagram, which is divided into three groups: Internal, Cloud, and Public. Azure Active Directory separates the Internal and Cloud groups, and SSL/JWT separates the Cloud and Public groups. At this time, we are unable to capture all of the information in the window. Future versions of this course should address this.](media/image3.png "Solution architecture diagram")

    From a high-level, a customer arrives to the airport with a bag that needs to be checked. The customer is attended to by an employee of Contoso Air with a computer. The employee affixes an RFID tag to the luggage and associates it with the customer and flight information using a PowerApps application. The PowerApps application triggers this information to be stored in Cosmos DB via an HttpTrigger.

    The luggage is then placed on the luggage conveyor belt, where an RFID scanner scans the tag. The RFID scanner utilizes MQTT protocol to send a status message for the luggage to an IoT Hub. The IoT Hub is configured with a Service Bus Queue endpoint and corresponding filter that identifies the status message. Once matched, message is then forwarded to the Service Bus Queue. Having the messages sent to the Service Bus Queue ensures reliability as items will not be removed from the queue until processed. Listening to this queue is an Azure Function which is then triggered and stores the current location of the luggage into Cosmos DB.

    The baggage handler then receives the luggage at the plane, as the luggage is loaded onto the plane, each one is scanned using a PowerApps mobile application where an Azure function is initiated via an HttpTrigger and the location of the luggage is updated as having been loaded on the plane. Once all luggage has been loaded onto the plane, the baggage handler application sends another message indicating all bags are loaded on the plane, this status is also sent along to Cosmos DB via an HttpTrigger. This is a great place to implement notifications for things such as a bag being loaded onto the wrong plane, or identifying bags that are missing from a flight. Luckily PowerApps has built in support for push notifications and can also initiate sending out email notifying personnel of these types of discrepancies.

    Meanwhile, the customer has boarded the flight, and as the cabin door is shut, they can access their Xamarin-based mobile application. Using information from their luggage receipt, the customer can see that their bag has made it safely on the flight.

    Using the same workflow as outlined above, once the flight has landed at its destination, each bag is scanned upon its removal from the plane and its location information is updated. The luggage is then placed on the luggage conveyor belt at baggage claim where RFID scanners will again scan them and update their location. The customer is then able to retrieve their bag from baggage claim.

    In the event that a piece of luggage has gone missing, due to the fact that its location is updated often during the baggage handling process, the last known location of the bag will be utilized to begin the search. This system would also identify if a bag may have been inadvertently directed toward an incorrect flight or placed on an incorrect baggage claim conveyor.

***NOTE: The preferred solution is only one of many possible, viable approaches.***

*Data Security*

1.  Given their existing services, how would you ensure that all communication to and from the system is secured?

    -   How would you authenticate and authorize an RFID scanner client?

        With the use of the Azure IoT SDK, authentication and authorization of a device can occur using the MQTT protocol automatically using only the IoT Hub connection string. Alternatively, MQTT can be used directly (in cases where the SDK can't be used) by issuing a CONNECT packet that provides a Client Id, Username and Password -- where password is a generated SAS token. It is important to note that MQTT tokens are time sensitive and have an expiration.

    -   How would you authenticate and authorize an employee using a client application?

        Given Contoso Air is already federating their AD, it makes sense that any employee-related client applications utilize Azure Active Directory.

    -   How would you authenticate and authorize a customer using a mobile application?

        Using the authentication extension of the backend server SDK for Azure Mobile App, federated authentication via Azure Active Directory, Facebook, Google, Microsoft or Twitter is possible. If their current external facing website uses a different identity provider, the SDK also allows for custom identity provider integration through custom code. Furthermore, API controllers and/or methods can be additionally secured individually, for instance, for a .NET backend, using the \[Authorize\] attribute.

2.  How would you ensure that in-transit data is secured?

    Communications into Azure IoT Hub can use TLS/SSL configuration, similarly when connecting the Xamarin applications to the Azure App Service, SSL may be used. Communications from employee applications are secured using Azure Active Directory with the credentials of the actual user.

*Data Ingestion*

1.  What format would you choose for the messages being ingested by the system?
    ```
    JSON format as it is currently the most popular format for modern IoT and Web Systems.
    ```

2.  Define the messages that need to be ingested

    -   Define the structure of the message sent from an employee checking in a bag for a customer
    ```
        {

        "baggageId": "value",

        "isBaggageMessage": true

        }
    ```

    -   Define the structure of the message sent from the RFID scanners
    ```
        {

        }
    ```

    -   Define the structure of the message sent from the baggage handler loading a bag into the plane
    ```
        {

        "baggageId": "value",

        "departure": "value",

        "lastKnownLocation": "value",

        "carouselNumber": "value"

        }
    ```

    -   Define the structure of the message sent from the baggage handler indicating that the last bag has been loaded into the plane
    ```
        {

        "scannerId": "value",

        "flightId": "value",

        "locationId": "value",

        "timestamp": "value",

        "status": "plane-loading-complete",

        "isBaggageMessage": false

        }
    ```

    -   Define the structure of the message sent from the baggage handler unloading a bag from the plane
    ```
        {

        "baggageId": "value",

        "departure": "value",

        "destination": "value",

3.  What is the anticipated volume in messages expected from the RFID IoT solution that Contoso Air will need to support given their employee and customer base?

    Contoso Air has distributed their Azure resources across 3 regions. At any given time, Contoso has an average of 120 active flights on the ground (processing baggage) at 60 locations worldwide. Each flight has an estimated 180 customers with an average of 360 checked bags. Each bag's location is recorded at minimum 5 times for each flight, 2 of which occur via RFID scanners. Assuming that it takes one hour to get bags from one location at an airport to another, at maximum, they can expect 120 (flights) x 360 (bags) x 2 (RFID checkpoints) messages per hour divided across their 3 Azure regions. (120 x 360 x 2)/3 = 28,800 messages per hour per region or 691,200 messages per day per region. As such, implementing an IoT hub in each region at the S2 level (unlimited devices, 6 million messages per day is required and provides much room for future growth). At the service bus level, approximately 22 million messages will be processed per month per region. This means the basic tier will suffice at \$0.05/million messages (\$1.10 per region per month).

4.  How would you propose they ingest that quantity of RFID messages? What Azure service(s) would you recommend and why? At what initial scale?

    As the daily messages exceed 400k per region, implementing an IoT hub in each region at the S2 level (unlimited devices, 6 million messages per day) is required and provides plenty of room for future growth. At the service bus level (queue), approximately 22 million messages will be processed per month per region. This means the basic tier will suffice at \$0.05/million messages (\$1.10 per region per month).

5.  What protocol would they use in sending data to the service(s) used for message ingestion?

    Currently the most popular protocol for IoT devices to send data to IoT Hub is via MQTT.

6.  Define any endpoint(s) used for message ingestion.

    .azure-devices.net

*Data Processing*

1.  What Azure service would you use to guarantee ingested data is processed reliably?

    Azure IoT Hub is designed to ingest data at a high scale. To ensure ingested data is processed reliably, a filter is defined to identify the incoming baggage messages that will forward them to a Service Bus Queue. This queue will house all messages until such a time that they are processed. This means that even during peak loads, no messages will be lost, and all messages will eventually be processed from this queue.

2.  How would you ensure that the data is processed with low-latency?

    IoT Hubs and Service Bus Queues are put in place in each of the 3 Azure regions chosen by Contoso Air. This means that data is processed closest to the source geographically thus reducing latency.

3.  Which Azure service would you use to persist the current state of the RFID luggage tag?

    Cosmos DB is chosen to persist the data and history of the RFID luggage tag.

4.  How will you ensure that persisted data is available at low-latency around the globe?

    Cosmos DB is automatically geographically replicated across all regions around the world. This ensures data is available globally at low-latency.

*Data Exposure*

1.  What Azure service would you recommend that will provide read-only luggage information to the Customer mobile application. Why did you make this choice?

    Azure Mobile Application Services will be used to service the Customer mobile application. These services extend Azure App Services by adding support for things like user sign-in and push notifications.

2.  What protocol is used when the Customer mobile application initiates communication with the service you decided upon in \#1?

    HTTPS will be used to ensure secure communication between the mobile application and the mobile App Services.

*Client Applications*

1.  Which Azure service do you recommend using for housing application source code?

    Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS)

2.  What Azure services do you recommend for automated builds, testing, and deployment?

    VSTS and Visual Studio App Center for the Xamarin Application. Visual Studio App Center provides a centralized conglomeration of services focusing on critical mobile development activities. These services include source control, automated builds/continuous integration, testing, distribution, persistent data storage, authentication (including AAD), crash reporting, and analytics.

3.  Which Azure service would you use to store application secrets, such as certificates or connection strings so that they aren't readily available in client application source control?

    Azure Key Vault

4.  How would you bridge data between on-premises systems and Microsoft Azure?

    The only area where on-premises data is required is through the employee applications that are implemented using PowerApps. PowerApps Data Gateway is a tool that provides a way to define hybrid connections between on-premises data sources and the employee PowerApps. Similarly, if the need arises, the Azure Service Bus can be used to create hybrid connections to on-premises data.

5.  What Azure service would you recommend for Contoso Air business users to be able to self-service a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that can be made available on both web and mobile?

    PowerApps provide a way for employees of Contoso Air to tailor their own applications to suit the needs of their everyday work.

## Checklist of preferred objection handling

1.  Contoso Air is worried about potential security-related disruptions to the system.

    Throughout the design of this solution, security has been at the forefront of the decisions. All communication between environments, devices, and regions are performed over secured channels. TLS/SSL from RFID channels, Active Directory and client credentials from employee applications, as well as SSL and a JWT-token based security in the Xamarin-based mobile application.

2.  There is concern over Azure's ability to communicate reliably with IoT RFID scanners.

    There are 3 Azure regions already defined for Contoso Air. The IoT hub and Service Bus Queues are implemented in all regions to ensure the best quality communication.

3.  Is Xamarin the right solution for the customer mobile applications?

    Xamarin Forms has been chosen as the solution for the mobile applications. This makes sense as the definition of the user interface is ubiquitous across all the target mobile platforms for this application, thus reducing development time.

4.  How does this solution guarantee low data latency?

    All Azure resources in this solution are either implemented or replicated into all main regions identified by Contoso Air.

5.  There will be multiple of scanners being used at a given time, does this solution scale?

    From an IoT perspective, the IoT hub has been designed to be able to ingest an immense amount of data. Given that the Contoso Air recommended tier for the IoT Hub (S2) allows for 6 million messages a day, they will only be expecting approximately 700K messages, allowing lots of space for future growth.

6.  The new system may require querying data from on-premises data sources, how do you bridge that gap?

    On-premises data can be bridged with PowerApps Data Gateway or a Hybrid connection endpoint defined in the Azure Service bus.

## Customer quote (to be read back to the attendees at the end)

*"Contoso Air is excited to be expanding its cloud capabilities with this solution. Azure has already proven itself from our previous projects and efforts. We are confident that this solution will allow us to improve our baggage metrics immensely while at the same time improving our customer satisfaction numbers!"*
