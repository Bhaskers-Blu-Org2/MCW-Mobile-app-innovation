# Mobile app innovation hands-on lab step-by-step 

## Abstract and learning objectives 

This package is designed to guide students through an implementation of an end-to-end mobile baggage tracking system for a customer in the airline industry. Students will design an IoT solution simulating data emitted from RFID tags attached to airline passengers' checked luggage, and mobile applications to allow employees and customers to track those bags from any device. Upon completion of the session, students will better understand how to:

-   Set up an IoT Hub, and register RFID devices

-   Consider the steps required to migrate legacy systems to the Azure platform

-   Connect on-premise applications to Azure using PowerApps Data Gateway

-   Use Azure Functions to send and receive data from Cosmos DB

-   Configure VSTS CI/CD pipelines

## Overview

The Mobile app innovation hands-on lab is an exercise that will challenge you to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Microsoft Azure and related services. The scenario will include implementing IoT Hub, App Center, Application Insights, Azure Functions, and Azure Cosmos DB. The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the workshop to model a real-world experience much closer and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![Icons that are connected by arrows comprise this diagram, which is divided into three groups: Internal, Cloud, and Public. Azure Active Directory separates the Internal and Cloud groups, and SSL/JWT separates the Cloud and Public groups. At this time, we are unable to capture all of the information in the window. Future versions of this course should address this.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image2.png "Solution architecture diagram")

From a high-level, a customer arrives to the airport with a bag that needs to be checked. The customer is attended to by an employee of Contoso Air with a computer. The employee affixes an RFID tag to the luggage and associates it with the customer and flight information using a PowerApps application. The mobile application triggers this information to be stored in Cosmos DB via an HttpTrigger.

The luggage is then placed on the luggage conveyor belt, where an RFID scanner scans the tag. The RFID scanner utilizes MQTT protocol to send a status message for the luggage to an IoT Hub. The IoT Hub is configured with a Service Bus Queue endpoint and corresponding filter that identifies the status message. Once matched, message is then forwarded to the Service Bus Queue. Having the messages sent to the Service Bus Queue ensures reliability as items will not be removed from the queue until processed. Listening to this queue, is an Azure Function which is then triggered and stores the current location of the luggage into Cosmos DB.

The baggage handler then receives the luggage at the plane, as the luggage is loaded onto the plane, each one is scanned using a Xamarin-based mobile application where an Azure function is initiated via an HttpTrigger and the location of the luggage is updated as having been loaded on the plane. Once all luggage has been loaded onto the plane, the baggage handler application sends another message indicating all bags are loaded on the plane, this status is also sent along to Cosmos DB via an HttpTrigger. This is a great place to implement notifications for things such as a bag being loaded onto the wrong plane, or identifying bags that are missing from a flight.

Meanwhile, the customer has boarded the flight, and as the cabin door is shut, they can access their Xamarin-based mobile application. Using information from their luggage receipt, the customer can see that their bag has made it safely on the flight.

Using the same workflow as outlined above, once the flight has landed at its destination, each bag is scanned upon its removal from the plane and its location information is updated. The luggage is then placed on the luggage conveyor belt at baggage claim where RFID scanners will again scan them and update their location. The customer is then able to retrieve their bag from baggage claim.

In the event that a piece of luggage has gone missing, due to the fact that its location is updated often during the baggage handling process, the last known location of the bag will be utilized to begin the search. This system would also identify if a bag may have been inadvertently directed toward an incorrect flight or placed on an incorrect baggage claim conveyor.

## Exercise 1: Set up your project in Visual Studio Team Services

**Duration**: 15 minutes

A robust DevOps chain is critical in being able to build, deploy, and monitor your app in the wild. This starts with strong source control, and a structured project management solution.

### Task 1: Create your project in Visual Studio Team Services

1.  Return to the instance of Visual Studio Team services you created at the start of this lab (e.g. <https://contosoair1234.visualstudio.com>)

2.  On the right-hand side of the main landing page, choose the **New Project** button.

    ![The New Project button is highlighted on the right side of the main landing page in your Visual Studio Team services instance.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image12.png "Create a new project")

3.  Name the project **ContosoBaggage**, and make sure that **Git** is selected for the **Version** **control**, and **Agile** for the **Work item process** (as shown in the image below).

4.  Select **Create** to create your new project.

    ![The information above is entered in the Create new project dialog box.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image13.png "Configure ContosoBaggage project settings")

### Task 2: Commit starter project to your VSTS project 

1.  Download the starter code from <http://bit.ly/2F2JQTa>, and extract the project to a new folder.

2.  Execute the following commands in PowerShell (or your favorite git client) to redirect the repository to your Team Services project:

    -   git remote remove origin

    -   git remote add origin

    -   <https://contosoair1234.visualstudio.com/_git/ContosoBaggage>git add -A

    -   git commit -m "Initial commit"

        i.  If the above fails with a message like "Please tell me who you are", then execute the following. Once the following is executed, rerun the git commit command above:

            1.  git config \--global user.email \"you\@example.com\"

            2.  git config \--global user.name \"Your Name\"

    -   git push -u origin --all

**Note**: Make sure to replace the URL in the sample above with the URL to your Git repository. If you are logged into Windows using the same Microsoft account that you're using in Azure and Visual Studio Team Services, then the code will upload. If not, you may be prompted for credentials. If you need to create git credentials:

1.  Browse to the **Code** tab in your Team Services project.

2.  Select the **Clone** button in the upper right hand corner of the code page.

3.  Select the **Generate Git credentials** button, and enter a username/password.

![The Code tab is highlighted in your Team Services project, Clone is highlighted below it, and Generate Git credentials is highlighted in the submenu.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image14.png "Create git credentials")

After these steps, you now have a working code base connected to your Visual Studio Team Services project, which will serve as the foundation of your DevOps strategy throughout this lab.

## Exercise 2: Configure Visual Studio App Center

**Duration**: 25 minutes

In this step, we'll explore how quick and easy it is to connect your mobile app to Visual Studio App Center. App Center provides best in class mobile app monitoring, along with a CI, and mobile app testing solution to ensure that any issues in your app are identified and resolve quickly.

10. Select **Save & Build**.

    This will build a Simulator build of your app, which doesn't require any Apple Developer Certificates. You can execute device builds by checking the "Sign builds" switch, and then attaching a certificate which you can generate at <https://developer.apple.com>. For simplicity of this lab, we won't perform this step.

11. Repeat steps 1 -- 7 for your Android app, and then choose the **ContosoBaggage.Droid.csproj** from your **Project** dropdown.

    ![The ContosoBaggage.Droid.csproj project is highlighted on the Build configuration page.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image34.png "Select the ContosoBaggage.Droid.csproj project")

As with the iOS app, the Android app requires a java keystore in order to sign/test/distribute your app. We will not complete this step, but please visit <https://developer.xamarin.com> for details on how to generate a keystore to include in your build.

### Task 7: Enable Telemetry (App Insights in App Center)

One of the most powerful features of Visual Studio App Center, is the ability to connect your analytics data into Application Insights for further slicing and dicing of your data.

1.  In App Center, locate your profile avatar in the bottom left hand corner. Select it, then choose **Account Settings**.

    ![Account Settings is selected under your profile avatar in App Center.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image35.png "Select Account Settings")

2.  Choose the **Azure** page, to see if you already have an Azure Subscription attached to your account. If you do, you can skip ahead to Step 5. Otherwise, continue with the next step to attach an Azure Subscription.

    ![A red arrow points at Azure under Settings on the left side of the Azure page.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image36.png "Verify if you have an Azure subscription")

    ![Application Insights and Set up standard export are selected and highlighted in the Data export dialog box.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image44.png "Select Set up standard export")

12. When prompted, select **Add to subscription**.

    ![Add to subscription is selected in the prompt.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image45.png "Select Add to subscription")

    This will now connect your app to Application Insights, and funnel your analytic data into Application Insights for further post processing using things like the powerful kusto querying language, and creating dashboards, etc.

13. Repeat steps 7 -- 11 for your Android app.

## Exercise 3: Configure Azure Cosmos DB and Azure functions

**Duration**: 30 minutes

Now that we've configured source control, crash reporting, and build steps for our mobile app, we can move on to deploying our backend. For this backend, we're going to leverage Azure Functions, which allows us to turn on micro services that you're only charged for when a call is made. With sub-second billing and multiple trigger options, Functions is a great way to modularize your backend and only pay for exactly the resources you use.

### Task 1: Configure your Cosmos DB instance

1.  Browse to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/)

2.  In the top left, select **Create Resource \> Databases \>** **Azure Cosmos DB**.

    ![Databases is selected under Azure Marketplace on the Azure portal, and Azure Cosmos DB is highlighted on the right.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image46.png "Select Azure Cosmos DB")

3.  Complete the new resource.

    Give the instance a unique name.

    Choose the **SQL** from the **API** dropdown (this will use DocumentDB under the hood).

    Uncheck enable geo-redundancy.

4.  Select **Create** to create the Cosmos DB instance.

### Task 2: Create collections in your Cosmos DB instance

Now that you've created your cosmos instance, we'll want to create collections for data to be written to.

1.  Browse to your Cosmos DB Instance.

2.  Choose the **Data Explorer** blade from the left-hand menu.

3.  Select the **New Collection** button.

4.  In the Add Collection form, provide the following:

    -   **Database id**: bagDatabase

    -   **Collection id**: FlightCollection

    -   **Storage capacity**: Fixed (10 GB)

    -   **Throughput**: 500

        ![The information above is entered in the Add Collection dialog box.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image48.png "Configure Add Collection settings")

5.  Select **OK**.

6.  Select the **New Collection** button again.

7.  In the Add Collection form, provide the following:

    -   **Database id**: bagDatabase

    -   **Collection id**: BagCollection

    -   **Storage capacity**: Fixed (10 GB)

    -   **Throughput**: 500

        ![The information above is entered in the Add Collection dialog box.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image49.png "Configure Add Collection settings")

8.  Select **OK**.

    ![Data Explorer is highlighted on the left side of the Azure portal, and on the right, New Collection is highlighted at the top, and FlightCollection and BagCollection are highlighted under the bagDatabase collection.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image50.png "View the Cosmos DB instance")

Our Cosmos DB instance is now configured and ready for us to use. We'll come back to this in a little bit when we set up our Functions app to read/write data from the collections.

### Task 8: Deploy your app to Azure

1.  Right-click on your Functions project and select **Publish.**

2.  Select **Azure Function App** and select **Existing**.

3.  Select the Settings icon and select **Create Profile**.

4.  Select the **Create Profile** button.

    ![Three red arrows point at Azure Function App, Select Existing, and Create Profile in your Functions project window, and Publish is selected on the left.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image62.png "Publish your app and create a profile")

5.  Select your Azure Subscription from the dropdown.

6.  Expand the Resource Group and select the Function App you created in the previous tasks.

7.  Select **OK**.

    ![A red arrow points at MyFunctionsApp in the App Service dialog box.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image63.png "Select the Function App that you created")

If you plan to attach a remote debugger, you'll need to perform one additional step here to make sure your code is compiled with Debug symbols. Do not complete these steps for production workloads. These are only appropriate for development.

1.  Select **Settings**.

    ![A red arrow points at Settings in the Publish dialog box.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image64.png "Select Settings")

2.  Change the Configuration to **Debug** and select **Save**.

    ![Debug \| Any CPU is highlighted in the Configuration box in the Profile Settings dialog box, and Save is selected on the bottom.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image65.png "Change the Configuration ")

3.  Select the **Publish** button.

If you get a warning indicating the version remotely doesn\'t match the local version, accept by clicking **Yes**.

4.  Copy the site URL and verify the function is running by using Postman to send that same GET request against the remote instance (e.g. http://myfunctionsapp.azurewebsites.net/api/GetFlights) and verify that you get a successful response (i.e. status code 200 OK). There will be no data yet since we haven't populated the databases, but this will at least confirm that your project is deployed successfully and running in Azure with no errors. If you don't have Postman installed, you can simply browse to the path in a new browser window. You should see an output displaying an XML tag similar to the following: \<ArrayOfFlight xmlns:i=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xmlns=\"http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/ContosoBaggage.Common.Models\"/\>

    ![The Site URL value is highlighted under Summary in the Publish dialog box.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image66.png "Verify that the function is running")

## Exercise 4: Set up IoT hub 

**Duration**: 20 minutes

Azure IoT Hub is a fully managed Azure service. This service enables reliable and secure bi-directional communications between millions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and a solution back end. One of the biggest challenges that IoT projects face is how to reliably and securely connect devices to the solution back end. To address this challenge, IoT Hub:

1.  Offers reliable device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device hyper-scale messaging.

2.  Enables secure communications using per-device security credentials and access control.

3.  Includes device libraries for the most popular languages and platforms.

This tutorial shows you how to:

1.  Use the Azure portal to create an IoT hub.

2.  Create a device identity in your IoT hub.

3.  Create a simulated RFID device sends messages to your IoT Hub.

In this task you will find three projects:

1.  **CreateDeviceIdentity**, which creates a device identity and associated security key to connect your device app.

2.  **SimulatedDevice**, which connects to your IoT hub with the device identity created earlier, and sends a telemetry message every second by using the MQTT protocol.

3.  **Telemetry**, which if you opt- in Microsoft will get usage about how you use IoT Hub.

### Task 1: Create the IoT hub in Azure

Create an IoT Hub for your simulated device app to connect to. The following steps show you how to complete this task by using the Azure portal.

1.  Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  Select **New \>** **Internet of Things \> IoT Hub**.

    ![+ New is highlighted on the left side of the Azure portal, Internet of Things is selected and highlighted under Azure Marketplace in the middle, and IoT Hub is highlighted on the right.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image67.png "Select IoT Hub")

3.  In the **IoT hub** pane, enter the following information for your IoT hub:

    -   **Name**: Create a name for your IoT hub. If the name you enter is valid, a green check mark appears.

    -   **Important:** The IoT hub will be publicly discoverable as a DNS endpoint, so make sure to avoid any sensitive information while naming it.

    -   **Pricing and scale tier**: For this tutorial, select the **F1 - Free** tier. For more information, see the [Pricing and scale tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/iot-hub/).

    -   **Resource group**: Select the same resource group you have been using for this lab.

    -   **Location**: Select the closest location to you.

    -   **Pin to dashboard**: Check this option for easy access to your IoT hub from the dashboard.

        ![The information above is entered in the IoT hub dialog box.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image68.png "Configure IoT hub settings")

4.  Select **Create**. Your IoT hub might take a few minutes to create. You can monitor the progress in the **Notifications** pane.

5.  When your new IoT hub is ready, select its tile in the Azure portal to open its properties window. Now that you have created an IoT hub, locate the important information that you use to connect devices and applications to your IoT hub. Make a note of the **Hostname**, and then select **Shared access policies**.

    ![Overview is selected on the left, and the Hostname value for your IoT hub is highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image69.png "Note the Hostname")

6.  In **Shared access policies**, select the **iothubowner** policy, and then make note of the IoT Hub connection string in the **iothubowner** window. For more information, see [Access control](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-security) in the \"IoT Hub developer guide."

    ![In Shared access policies, Shared access policies is selected on the left, iothubowner is selected and highlighted under Policy in the middle, and the Connection string---primary key box and value are highlighted on the right.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image70.png "Note the IoT Hub connection string")

You have now created your IoT hub, and you have the host name and IoT Hub connection string that you need to complete the rest of this tutorial.

### Task 2: Create a device identity

In this task, you will create a .NET console app that creates a device identity in the identity registry in your IoT hub. A device cannot connect to IoT hub unless it has an entry in the identity registry. For more information, see the \"Identity registry\" section of the [IoT Hub developer guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-identity-registry). When you run this console app, it generates a unique device ID and key. Your device uses these values to identify itself when it sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub. Device IDs are case-sensitive.

1.  In Visual Studio, open the **IoTHubGetStarted.sln** solution from the src/IoTSimulator folder where you extracted the lab files.

2.  Expand the **CreateDeviceIdentity** project, then open the **Program.cs** file.

3.  Locate the **ConnectionString** variable on line 13 and paste your IoTHub connection string for the iothubowner policy you copied in the previous task.

    ![The ConnectionString variable is highlighted in the Program.cs window on the left, and a red arrow points at Program.cs in the Solution Explorer pane on the right.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image71.png "Paste the IoTHub connection string")

4.  Save your changes and run the CreateDeviceIdentity program, then make a note of the device key.

    ![The device key is highlighted in the Command Prompt window.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image72.png "Note the device key")

**Note:**

The IoT Hub identity registry only stores device identities to enable secure access to the IoT hub. The identity registry stores device IDs and keys to use as security credentials. The identity registry also stores an enabled/disabled flag for each device that you can use to disable access for that device. If your application needs to store other device-specific metadata, it should use an application-specific store. For more information, see [IoT Hub developer guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-identity-registry).

### Task 3: Set up the backend keys for the database and Functions

Part 1: Database and Application Insights Keys

1.  Under the **SimulatedDevice** project, open the **Keys.cs** file.

2.  Browse to <https://portal.azure.com>, and locate your Cosmos DB instance.

3.  Select **Keys** from the left-hand menu.

    -   In the Read-write Keys tab, copy the URI and paste it as the value of **URL** within the Cosmos class in **Keys.cs**.

    -   In the Read-write Keys tab, copy the Primary Key and paste it as the value of **Key** within the Cosmos class in **Keys.cs**.
        
        ![Keys is highlighted under Settings on the left side of the Azure portal, and on the right, the URI and Primary Key boxes are highlighted on the Read-write Keys tab.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image57.png "Copy and paste the Primary Key value")

4.  Browse to <https://portal.azure.com>, and locate your Application Insights instance.

5.  On the Overview blade, copy the Instrumentation Key.
    
    ![The Instrumentation Key value is highlighted on the Overview blade, and the Click to copy button is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image59.png "Copy the Instrumentation Key")

-   Paste the Instrumentation Key as the value of **Key** within the **Analytics** class in **Keys.cs**.

6.  Save your changes.

Part 2: Function URL

1.  Under the **SimulatedDevice** project, locate the **Services** folder and open file **FlightService.cs**.

2.  Browse to <https://portal.azure.com>, and locate your Azure Functions instance.

3.  In the Overview blade, locate the URL of your function.
    ![AppInnovationBackend is highlighted on the left in the Azure Functions instance, and the URL value is highlighted on the right.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image73.png "Locate your function ?s URL")

4.  Copy and paste that value into the base URL (line 17). Be sure to keep the {0} on the end of the string.
    ```
    string \_baseUrl = \"https://your-function-url-here.azurewebsites.net{0}\";
    ```

### Task 4: Set up the program to scan the bags

1.  In the IoTHubGetStarted Visual Studio project, open **Program.cs** within the **SimulatedDevice** project. Update the **Program** class with the following:

    -   Substitute {iot hub hostname} with the IoT hub host name you retrieved in the \"Create an IoT hub\" section.

    -   Substitute {device key} with the device key you retrieved in the \"Create a device identity\" section.
    ```
        static  DeviceClient  deviceClient;

        static  string  iotHubUri  =  "{iot hub hostname}";

        static  string  deviceKey  =  "{device key}";
    ```

2.  By default, the **Create** method in a .NET Framework app creates a **DeviceClient** instance that uses the AMQP protocol to communicate with IoT Hub. To use the MQTT or HTTPS protocol, use the override of the **Create** method that enables you to specify the protocol. UWP and PCL clients use the HTTPS protocol by default. If you use the HTTPS protocol, you should also add the **Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Client** NuGet package to your project to include the **System.Net.Http.Formatting** namespace.

### Task 5: Run the program to scan the bags

1.  Around line 35 enter in the Flight that you would like to update the bags for:

```
static string myFlightNumber = "FL1234";
```

2.  Run the **SimulatedDevice** project. You should see the bags updating in the Console app. The backend might take a few minutes to set up.

    ![Bag updates are displayed in the Console app after running the SimulatedDevice project.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image74.png "Run the SimulatedDevice project")

3.  The **Usage** tile in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) shows the number of messages sent to the IoT hub:

    ![This is a screenshot of the Usage tile.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image75.png "View the Usage tile")

## Exercise 5: Connect the mobile app to the backend

**Duration**: 30 minutes

Now that we've configured backend and populated it with data, we'll configure our mobile app to be able to consume the data from our Functions.

### Task 1: Connect app to Azure backend

1.  Browse to <https://portal.azure.com>, and locate your Functions app that you created in Exercise 3 above.

2.  On the Overview blade, locate the URL for your function app. Copy the URL.

    ![AppInnovationBackend is highlighted on the left in the Azure Functions instance, and the URL value is highlighted on the right.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image76.png "Locate your function ?s URL")

3.  Open the **ContosoBaggage.sln** solution from your /src/ContosoBaggage folder of your project.

4.  Expand the **ContosoBaggage** project and locate the **FlightService.cs** file under the Services folder.

5.  Locate the variable \_**baseUrl** (it should be somewhere around line \#23).

6.  Paste the URL that you copied in Step 2 above, into the \_**baseUrl** variable. Make sure to preserve the {0} at the end of the URL. The code later on uses **string.Format()** to add a specific function call.
    
    ![The \_baseUrl variable's value is highlighted in the FlightService.cs file.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image77.png "Paste the URL")

### Task 2: Create a Flight List page

1.  Locate the Pages folder in the ContosoBaggage project.

2.  Right-click the folder, then choose **Add \> New Item**.

    ![The Pages folder is selected in Solution Explorer on the left, and New Item is highlighted in the Add submenu of the shortcut menu.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image78.png "Add a new item")

3.  Choose **Xamarin.Forms \> Content Page** and name the page **FlightListPage.xaml**.

![Xamarin.Forms is highlighted on the left side of the Add New Item -- ContosoBaggage project, Content Page is highlighted on the right, and FlightListPage.xaml is highlighted in the Name box below.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image79.png "Name the page FlightListPage.xaml")

4.  Select **Add**.

5.  Replace the contents of FlightListPage.xaml with the following:

                IsBusy = true;
                GetFlightsCommand.ChangeCanExecute();
                try
                {
                    Flights.Clear();

                    var flights = await FlightService.GetFlights();
                    foreach (var flight in flights.OrderByDescending(x => x.FlightDate))
                    {

                        { "StackTrace", ex.ToString() }
                    });
                }
                finally

                Flights = new ObservableCollection<Flight>();
            }
        }
    }

    ```

### Task 4: Connect the View Model to the page

1.  Browse to the Pages folder of ContosoBaggage. Expand the **FlightListPage.xaml** to reveal **FlightListPage.xaml.cs**

    ![FlightListPage.xaml.cs is selected and highlighted under FlightListPage.xaml in the Pages folder of ContosoBaggage.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image81.png "Reveal FlightListPage.xaml.cs")

2.  Replace the implementation of the FlightListPage class with the following code:
    ```
    public partial class FlightListPage : BaseContentPage<FlightListViewModel>, INavigableXamarinFormsPage
    {
        public FlightListPage()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        protected override void OnAppearing()
        {
            base.OnAppearing();

            if (ViewModel.Flights.Count > 0 || ViewModel.IsBusy)
                return;

            ViewModel.GetFlightsCommand.Execute(null);
        }
    }

    ```

### Task 5: Add Flight List page to the navigation service

1.  Browse to the Navigation folder of ContosoBaggage. Open **NavigationService.cs**.

    ![NavigationService.cs is selected and highlighted in the Navigation folder of ContosoBaggage.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image82.png "Open NavigationService.cs")

2.  Find the **GetPage** method and uncomment the **return new FlightListPage();** line. Final result should be:
    ```
    private Page GetPage(PageNames page)
    {
        switch(page)
        {
            case PageNames.MainPage:
    return new MainPage();
            case PageNames.FlightListPage:
                        return new FlightListPage();
    case PageNames.FlightDetailsPage:
                        return new FlightDetailsPage();
    case PageNames.BagDetailsPage:
                        return new BagDetailsPage();
            default:
                return null;
        }
    }

    ```

### Task 6: Run the app and verify that it successfully retrieves flight data

1.  Right-click on either the iOS or Android app (whichever you plan to debug), then choose **Set as StartUp Project**.

2.  Choose your simulator/device to launch the app on.

3.  Launch the app by choosing **Debug \> Start Debugging**.

4.  If you receive the following error, perform the steps below: "The project ContosoBaggage.Droid needs to be deployed before it can be started. Verify the project is selected to be deployed in the Solution Configuration Manager":

    -   Right-click the solution, then select **Configuration Manager...**

    -   Check **Deploy** next to the project.

        ![The Deploy check box is highlighted next to the ContosoBaggage.Droid project in Configure Manager.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image83.png "Deploy the project")

        ![Start Debugging is highlighted in the Debug menu of the app that you are debugging.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image84.png "Start debugging")

        ![This is a screenshot of the app running on a smartphone.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image85.png "App screenshot")
