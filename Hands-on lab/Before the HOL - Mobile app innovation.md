## Before the hands-on lab

**Duration**: 60 minutes

Completing this lab will require accounts for Azure, Visual Studio Team Services, and Visual Studio App Center, as well as an up-to-date installation of Visual Studio on Windows 10. In this exercise, we will walk through the steps needed for each of these tasks and set up your environment to complete this lab.

### Task 1: Create an account, and sign into the Azure portal

Throughout this lab, you will utilize an Azure subscription, and a Microsoft account. If you do not already have an Azure subscription, please follow the instructions at <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/> to set up your account. If you already have an account in <https://portal.azure.com>, then you can continue to the next task.

### Task 2: Sign into Visual Studio Team Services, and create a new account

1.  Browse to <https://visualstudio.com>, and sign in with the Microsoft account used to access the Azure Portal in the previous step

2.  If you have not already created an account in Visual Studio Team services, select the button to create a new app

    ![Create new account icon](images/Setup/image3.png "Create new account icon")
    
3.  Choose a name for your project (it will need to be unique), and choose "Git" as the source control mechanism

4.  Select **Continue**

    ![On the Visual Studio Team services project creation page, ContosoAir is entered in the box next to .visualstudio.com under Host my projects at, Git is selected below Manage code using, and Continue is selected at the bottom of the page.](images/Setup/image4.png "Create a new app")

After a few minutes, your new account will be created, and a new project (MyFirstProject) will be automatically created. We won't use this project for the app, but you can just ignore it and leave it in your account.

### Task 3: Sign into Visual Studio App Center

In addition to the Azure portal, you will utilize Visual Studio App Center for building and monitoring your mobile app. Please browse to <https://appcenter.ms/apps> and sign in with the same Microsoft account you used in the previous task. This will ensure that you can utilize things like data export between App Center and Application Insights in Azure.

### Task 4: Update VS 2017 to 15.7.4

1.  Launch Visual Studio 2017

2.  Select **Help \> Check for Updates**

![In Visual Studio 2017, Help Menu is open Check for Updates is highlighted.](images/Setup/image5.png "Check for Updates Visual Studio 2017")

        ![The Workloads tab is open and the Mobile development with .NET checkbox is checked.](images/Setup/image7.png "Check the Mobile development workload checkbox")
    
    -   The **Azure development** workload is located in the **Web and Cloud** section
    
        ![The Workloads tab is open and the Azure development checkbox is checked.](images/Setup/image7.0.png "Check the Azure development workload checkbox")

5.  Once all updates are completed installing, restart Visual Studio

### Task 5: Update Android SDKs

To complete these exercises, you will need to make sure you have all the correct Android SDKs. This requires some additional steps after completing the upgrade.

1.  Launch Visual Studio 2017

2.  Select **Tools \> Android \> Android SDK Manager**

3.  Select each of the Android SDK platforms from 5.0 (Lollipop) -- 8.0 (Oreo)

5.  Choose the **Tools** tab

6.  Make sure that a version 27.0.x of Android SDK Platform-Tools and Android SDK Build-Tools are installed

    ![Android SDK Platform-Tools and Android SDK Build-Tools are selected on the Tools tab of the Android SDKs and Tools dialog box.](images/Setup/image10.png "Verify that Android SDK Tools and Android SDK Build Tools are selected")

7.  If the available Android SDK Platform-Tools version is less than 27.0.x, select the **Updates Available** button on the bottom-left corner of the dialog

    ![Android SDK Platform-Tools and Android SDK Build-Tools are selected on the Tools tab of the Android SDKs and Tools dialog box, Version 25.0.3 is highlighted next to Android SDK Platform-Tools, and the Updates Available button is highlighted at the bottom.](images/Setup/image11.png "Update the Android SDK Platform-Tools version if necessary")

8.  After installing the updates, you may need to re-select the **Android SDK Build Tools** and **Platform-Tools**

9.  Select **Apply Changes**

You should follow all steps provided *before* attending the Hands-on lab.
