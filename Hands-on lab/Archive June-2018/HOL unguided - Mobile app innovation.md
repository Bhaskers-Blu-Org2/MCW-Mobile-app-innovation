## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this hands-on lab, you will implement the steps to build an IoT solution for an end-to-end mobile baggage tracking system, that leverages cloud services and cross-platform mobile development.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will discover how to leverage Azure services to implement an IoT solution that includes, RFID tracking, mobile apps, and a continuous integration pipeline for developers.

## Overview

The Mobile app innovation hands-on lab is an exercise that will challenge you to implement an end-to-end scenario using a supplied sample that is based on Microsoft Azure and related services. The scenario will include implementing IoT Hub, App Center, Application Insights, Azure Functions, and Azure Cosmos DB. The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the workshop to more closely model a real-world experience and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![Icons that are connected by arrows comprise this diagram, which is divided into three groups: Internal, Cloud, and Public. Azure Active Directory separates the Internal and Cloud groups, and SSL/JWT separates the Cloud and Public groups. At this time, we are unable to capture all of the information in the window. Future versions of this course should address this.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image2.png "Solution architecture diagram")

From a high-level, a customer arrives to the airport with a bag that needs to be checked. The customer is attended to by an employee of Contoso Air with a computer. The employee affixes an RFID tag to the luggage and associates it with the customer and flight information using a PowerApps application. The mobile application triggers this information to be stored in Cosmos DB via an HttpTrigger.

The luggage is then placed on the luggage conveyor belt, where an RFID scanner scans the tag. The RFID scanner utilizes MQTT protocol to send a status message for the luggage to an IoT Hub. The IoT Hub is configured with a Service Bus Queue endpoint and corresponding filter that identifies the status message. Once matched, message is then forwarded to the Service Bus Queue. Having the messages sent to the Service Bus Queue ensures reliability as items will not be removed from the queue until processed. Listening to this queue is an Azure Function, which is then triggered to store the current location of the luggage into Cosmos DB.

The baggage handler then receives the luggage at the plane. As the luggage is loaded onto the plane, each one is scanned using a Xamarin-based mobile application where an Azure function is initiated via an HttpTrigger, and the location of the luggage is updated as having been loaded on the plane. Once all luggage has been loaded onto the plane, the baggage handler application sends another message indicating that all bags are loaded on the plane. This status is also sent along to Cosmos DB via an HttpTrigger. This is a great place to implement notifications for things, such as a bag being loaded onto the wrong plane, or identifying bags that are missing from a flight.

Meanwhile, the customer has boarded the flight, and as the cabin door is shut, they can access their Xamarin-based mobile application. Using information from their luggage receipt, the customer can see that their bag has made it safely on the flight.

Using the same workflow as outlined above, once the flight has landed at its destination, each bag is scanned upon its removal from the plane and its location information is updated. The luggage is then placed on the luggage conveyor belt at baggage claim where RFID scanners will again scan them and update their location. The customer is then able to retrieve their bag from baggage claim.

In the event that a piece of luggage has gone missing, due to the fact that its location is updated often during the baggage handling process, the last known location of the bag will be utilized to begin the search. This system would also identify if a bag may have been inadvertently directed toward an incorrect flight or placed on an incorrect baggage claim conveyor.

## Exercise 3: Configure Azure Cosmos DB and Azure functions

**Duration**: 30 minutes

Now that we've configured source control, crash reporting, and build steps for our mobile app, we can move on to deploying our backend. For this backend, we're going to leverage Azure Functions, which allows us to turn on micro services that you're only charged for when a call is made. With sub-second billing and multiple trigger options, Functions is a great way to modularize your backend and only pay for exactly the resources you use.

#### Exit criteria

-   You can successfully compile the solution

### Task 8: Deploy your app to Azure

#### Tasks to complete

-   Publish your Functions project to your existing Azure Function App in Azure

-   Modify the publish profile settings to use the Debug \| Any CPU configuration. This allows you to attach a remote debugger for development only. This should not be set for production deployments.

#### Exit criteria

-   After publishing, copy the site URL and verify the function is running by pasting it in a new browser window or creating a GET request in Postman. There will be no data since we haven't populated the databases, but this will at least confirm that your project is deployed successfully and running in Azure with no errors.

## Exercise 4: Setup IoT hub

**Duration**: 20 minutes

Azure IoT Hub is a fully managed Azure service. This service enables reliable and secure bi-directional communications between millions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and a solution back end. One of the biggest challenges that IoT projects face is how to reliably and securely connect devices to the solution back end. To address this challenge, IoT Hub:

-   Offers reliable device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device hyper-scale messaging

-   Enables secure communications using per-device security credentials and access control

-   Includes device libraries for the most popular languages and platforms

This tutorial shows you how to:

-   Use the Azure portal to create an IoT hub

-   Create a device identity in your IoT hub

-   Create a simulated RFID device sends messages to your IoT Hub

In this task you will find three projects:

-   **CreateDeviceIdentity**, which creates a device identity and associated security key to connect your device app

-   **SimulatedDevice**, which connects to your IoT hub with the device identity created earlier, and sends a telemetry message every second by using the MQTT protocol

-   **Telemetry**, which if you opt in, Microsoft will get usage about how you use IoT Hub

### Task 1: Create the IoT hub in Azure

Create an IoT Hub for your simulated device app to connect to

#### Tasks to complete

-   Create an IoT Hub instance from within Azure

-   Select the **F1 -- Free** tier for this lab

-   Copy the Hostname value

-   Copy the IoT Hub connection string from the iothubowner shared access policy

#### Exit criteria

-   You have now created your IoT hub, and you have the host name and IoT Hub connection string that you need to complete the rest of this tutorial

### Task 2: Create a device identity

In this task, you will create a .NET console app that creates a device identity in the identity registry in your IoT hub. A device cannot connect to IoT hub unless it has an entry in the identity registry. For more information, see the \"Identity registry\" section of the [IoT Hub developer guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-identity-registry). When you run this console app, it generates a unique device ID and key. Your device uses these values to identify itself when it sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub. Device IDs are case-sensitive.

#### Tasks to complete

-   In Visual Studio, open the **IoTHubGetStarted.sln** solution from the src/IoTSimulator folder where you extracted the lab files

-   Update the **ConnectionString** variable within the Program.cs file of the **CreateDeviceIdentity** project with your IoT Hub connection string you copied in the previous task

#### Exit criteria

-   Run the CreateDeviceIdentity program, then copy the generated device key. You will use this value later.

### Task 3: Set up the backend keys for the database and Functions

#### Tasks to complete

-   Open the **Keys.cs** file within the **SimulatedDevice** project

-   Paste the URI value you copied from the Cosmos DB Read-write Keys tab as the value of **Url** within the **Cosmos** class in **Keys.cs**

-   Paste the Application Insights Instrumentation Key you copied earlier, as the value of??**Key** within the **Analytics** class??in **Keys.cs**

-   Expand the Services folder and open **FlightService.cs**

-   Copy your Function App URL and paste the value into the base URL (line 17). Be sure to keep the {0} on the end of the string.

#### Exit criteria

-   Your simulated device project is configured to access Cosmos DB and send data to your Azure Functions

### Task 4: Set up the program to scan the bags

#### Tasks to complete

-   In the IoTHubGetStarted Visual Studio project, open **Program.cs** within the **SimulatedDevice** project. Update the **Program** class with the following:

    -   Substitute {iot hub hostname} with the IoT hub host name you retrieved in the \"Create an IoT hub\" section

    -   Substitute {device key} with the device key you retrieved in the \"Create a device identity\" section

#### Exit criteria

-   The SimulatedDevice project is configured to send data to your IoT Hub instance on behalf of the simulated device identity you created earlier

### Task 5: Run the program to scan the bags

#### Tasks to complete

-   Around line 35, enter in the Flight that you would like to update the bags for

```csharp
static string myFlightNumber = "FL1234";
```

-   Run the **SimulatedDevice** project. You should see the bags updating in the Console app. The backend might take a few minutes to set up.

    ![Bag updates are displayed in the Console app after running the SimulatedDevice project.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image12.png "Run the SimulatedDevice project")

#### Exit criteria

-   The **Usage** tile in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) shows the number of messages sent to the IoT hub:

    ![This is a screenshot of the Usage tile.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Mobileappinnovationimages/media/image13.png "View the Usage tile")

## Exercise 5: Connect the mobile app to the backend

**Duration**: 30 minutes

Now that we've configured backend and populated it with data, we'll configure our mobile app to be able to consume the data from our Functions.

### Task 1: Connect app to Azure backend

#### Tasks to complete

-   Open the **ContosoBaggage.sln** solution from your /src/ContosoBaggage folder of your project

-   Open FlightService.cs under the Services folder of the ContosoBaggage project

-   Update the \_baseUrl with your Function App URL. Make sure to preserve the {0} at the end of the URL

#### Exit criteria

-   Your mobile app is configured to connect to your Azure Functions

### Task 2: Create a Fight List page

#### Tasks to complete
